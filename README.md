# RoboMaster_General_Control
This is a C project to simulate the control of HKU robomaster fighters. The codes will be applied onto general standard robot without special functions. 
To simulate the I/O of the control board, one needs to enter the values of signals and the feedbacks, including: 
----RCRL: right-left channel of remote controller 
----RCFB: forward-backward channel of remote controller
----RCVR: vertical rotation channel of remote controller
----RCHR: horizontal rotation channel of remote controller
----MOUY: Y-axis of mouse
----MOUX: X-axis of mouse
----MOUL: left switch of mouse
----MOUR: right switch of mouse
----KEYW: key-W
----KEYA: key-A
----KEYS: key-S
----KEYD: key-D
----KEYQ: key-Q
----KEYE: key-E
----HIGH: key-HIGh
----SWIN: key-SWING
----SW-1: SW-1 of remote controller
----SW-2: SW-2 of remote controller
----SIGN: feedback from motor
----EXIT: signal to exit
